**0xXyc/0xXyc** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on shadow stack stuff (ARM and Intel)

- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a partner to collaborate with on my C maldev adventure.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: DM
